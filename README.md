# Overview

The Addiction Ontology (AddictO) is an ontology for representing entities relevant to all aspects of addiction research 
and clinical practice. It includes the E-Cigarette Ontology (E-CigO) which covers all substantive entities that may be referred to in research reports and commentaries relating to e-cigarettes.

The project is being developed using the [BFO](http://basic-formal-ontology.org/) upper level ontology
and following best practices as set out by the [OBO Foundry](http://www.obofoundry.org/). 
 
It is funded by the [Society for the Study of Addiction](https://www.addiction-ssa.org/) with the E-Cigarette Ontology supported by [Cancer Research UK](https://www.cancerresearchuk.org/) and is expected to underpin a new tool for semantically annotating research reports that are submitted to the journal Addiction, the Addiction Paper Authoring Tool.   

The ontology content can be browsed at http://addictovocab.org, and a downloadable version of the ontology is available at http://addictovocab.org/addicto.owl.

# Related Projects

The Addiction Ontology project relies on ontologies developed in the context of the [Human Behaviour-Change Project](https://www.humanbehaviourchange.org/) such as the the Behaviour Change Intervention Ontology (BCIO). It furthermore harnesses content from the Mental Functioning ([MF](https://github.com/jannahastings/mental-functioning-ontology/)) and Emotion ([EM](https://github.com/jannahastings/emotion-ontology/tree/master/ontology)) ontologies.
